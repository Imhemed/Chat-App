## **Overview**

My first attempt at building an app layout

**### The challenge**

The challenge was provided by Front-end mentor

the challenge is to build an app layout of a chat app and make the chat play out as a real chat would

of course, it will work on desktop and mobile view

### **Built with**

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### **What I learned**

I learned how to :

- make a custom radio button
- how to add shadows
- how to use position relative and absolute
- how to debug code and finds the errors and how to correct them

### **Continued development**

I need to learn how to plan projects efficiently and how to use advanced selectors to improve my workflow and how to animate better
